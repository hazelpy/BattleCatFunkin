Amongst all the global issues,
civil wars, financial crises, terrorism...
A brand new threat appears...
The Battle Cats.

We found it too hard
to fight back, because
these Cats... are too cute.

We are powerless to their reign.
We cannot stop their legion.
But you! You could stop them
with your rap battling and singing,
but that's besides the point.

Come to think of it,
cats have already invaded the internet too...
We have the best information technology systems,
and we use them to look at cats.

Y'know...
The developer of these 'Battle Cats'
was interviewed on live television. 
It went like this...

"Why is the new weapon a Cat?"

and he answered - 

"Because I love Cats."

...are you serious?

I've just had a look at
what I've written here.
It's horrible. So, so horrible.
I've forgotten how terrible my writing was.



My biggest mistake was, well,
I don't know who I'm talking to here, but,
I remember my days as a child.
I aspired to be a major leaguer.

Now...
Now I want to be a millionaire CEO of
a Social Networking Service.





I mean...
If you have money,
you don't need love, right?
YES / NO



Whatever the answer is...
I want to tell you one thing.





These "Battle Cats" aren't so bad.



That's pretty much it.
